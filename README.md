This code analyzes user voice and train the computer to it so it can be identified later and determine the word said by the user. This code can be a core for very exciting projects like turning speech to text or making a voice password that can't be hacked.
The code is implemented in six functions and two scripts one for training and that needs to be used only once to update the code.mat file which holds voice data and the other for testing the recognition system. The code works with high speed and smallest response time on MATLAB platform.
